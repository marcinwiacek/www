<ul><li>2 April - Gammu in Debian (hurray !)
</li><li>13 April - Gammu.net lost. There is registered Gammu.org instead
</li><li>18 April - Gammu 1.06.00 released. I have done many small steps inside:<br /><pre>
20060418 - 1.06.00
[!] No more gammu.net. There is gammu.org instead. We release
    this version as 1.06.00, because we want force people to upgrade
    link
[+] Some new texts in Polish localisation (Tomek Fizyk)
[*] SMSD DB updated to version 6. There should be "real" UTF8 used now
<!--break-->
    and less problems with MySQL 5 (of course, PHP and SMSD updated too)
[*] New method of informing about changes in ChangeLog:
    [!] Important
    [+] New functionality
    [*] Changes in existing functionality
    [-] Fixed error
[*] gammu.txt -&gt; gammu.htm (from Wiki, currently temporary version)
[*] readme.txt redirects to wiki
[*] new functions for utf8
[-] * Fix, when config file not available (Michal Cihar)
[-] * Fix for SMSD
[-] * as there are architectures where char is unsigned by
      default, for SMS-&gt;Class we need to explicitly use signed one
      (it is set/compared for -1)
[-] * avoid error in configure when rpm is not installed
[-] * second changes type used for length to size_t, which is big enough
      to hold possible pointer size
[-] improved vcf restoring
</pre><p>
The same with gammu.org - there are many small things changed especially inside wiki.</p>
</li><li>near future - I hope to end SMS for Gammu+ to end of April, I should end gammu.org main changes too. I hope, that wiki will explain many software issues then.
</li></ul><p>Few more issues: There are many emails about cables and new phones. But what can I do without them ? And what should I do after ending SMS for Gammu+ ? How earn money ? Symbian ? Will I have enought time for making everything planned inside my favourite projects ? I will see :-D</p>
