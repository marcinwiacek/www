<ul><li>Gammu 1.08.07 is out
<ul><li>I would like to announce with pleasure, that I have started rewriting and completing Series 40 3.0 SMS reading. Many things are still magic, but you have at least much more info now...
</li><li>GCC 4 is hacked for now (no warnings)
</li><li>updated translations and license
</li><li>added some bugfixes
</li><li>included improved Mozilla support. It will be reviewed by me now and all fixes to it will be in next test release...
<!--break-->
</li></ul></li><li>Gammu+ - almost ready new release. Expect it soon.
</li><li>gammu.org - I will reactivate Licenses link on left side soon...<br /><i>
<li>as you probably notified, I have described very many details various problems/tips for [[HydePark:Nx6325|HP NX6325 series notebooks]]. This is quite good 64 bit platform, but not at all. Based on own/friends experiences.
</li><li>I still think about buying:
<ul><li>N6233
</li><li>MS Vista (it will be available for companies this year and maybe somebody could buy legally for me license/OEM license; if not, it will be dropped for next year)
</li></ul></li><li>...but after today university day I see, that my diploma work won't be so easy and I will need to work less (I don't speak about Gammu/Gammu+, but rather about sitting in office, where I was making things during few last months). It means - no money and probably only buying one thing from previous point will be possible (after selling some my personal things).<br /></li></i>
