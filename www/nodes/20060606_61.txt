<ul><li>like Michal notified <a href="http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2006/05/22/gammu_hit_1_mib_of_sources/">here</a> Gammu tarball is bigger than 1 MB :-)
</li><li>Michal wants to rewrite Wammu - read <a href="http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2006/05/23/wammu_future_for_second_time/">here</a> about this project future
<!--break-->
</li><li>Gammu is more and more popular - I have aded few new links for projects, scripts, descriptions, etc.
</li><li><b><u>There is finally run Mantis on gammu.org. Use it for reporting Gammu/Gammu+ bugs. You can report bug, upload files, etc.</u></b>
</li><li>main targets for now:
<ul><li>Gammu now: implementing all gnapplet things, ending all past issues, ending Series 40 3rd edition support (based on N6111, not 6233 like planned earlier)
</li><li>Gammu in the future: extending gnapplet, getting Series 60 3rd edition phone and trying compiling gnapplet there
</li><li>Gammu+ now: SMSD, implementing gnapplet
</li><li>gammu.org now: ending phones database (users login, adding comments, etc.)
</li><li>other: passing all things for studies (still few things and days) and getting 64 bit CPU ;-)
</li></ul></li><li>I though a lot about synchronisation issues too - I think, that at least Gammu+ should inform user about, which (phonebook, calendar, etc.) details were correctly added, which not
</li></ul><p>Other:</p>

Excluding VCALENDAR and VCARDS (changed because of ICS) all functions should work rather good. If nothing new will happen, I should release 1.07.00 in June.</p>
