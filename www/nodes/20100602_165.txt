<p>Like promised I have closed gammu.org in current form. </p>
<p>Started 1 April 2005 under gammu.net address, in April 2006 was moved into current domain (gammu.org).</p>
<p>First in the form of static pages, later created using <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a>.</p>
<p>I was publishing there some non GSM texts too, tried to make some phone database with info about firmware changes, versions, pictures....</p>
<p>Big shame, but don't worry...</p>
<h1>What next ?</h1>
<!--break-->
<p>I have backup on my HDD - if something should be moved to wammu.eu, please let me know. Domain has been payed, maybe I will reactivate it in the future (we will see).</p>
<p>About Nokia - this is not too good company in my opinion now. They were never interested in helping Gammu and similar projects, N900 was also joke. The main problem is that they still try to reanimate Symbian. This is similar to Microsoft - they believe in their Windows and Office. And what we have ? Apple grows, Microsoft is sinking in the NASDAQ.</p>
<p>Nokia phones are not too interesting for me in this moment, I'm searching for something different. For now I have started to write about Linux (in Polish language)...  If you could suggest something, please use comments or contact me directly... Maybe creating Open Source software as full time job ? :)</p>
