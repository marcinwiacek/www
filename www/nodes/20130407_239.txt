<p>There were many formats of documents created over years, ISTQB provides own glossary in PDF format. I decided to convert it some time ago to form of Android application: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mwiacek.istqb.glossary">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mwiacek.istqb.glossary</a>. You can search topics, jump to related topics, etc. Small, fast, effective.</p>
