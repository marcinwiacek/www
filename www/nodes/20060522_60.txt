</pre><p>
As you see, we have finally some functionality with Symbian. There is used gnapplet. We will try to have compatiblity with its' protocol as long as possible, but even now there are visible some areas, where it should fixed.</p>
<p>After Gammu support we will create adequate Gammu+ module for it.</p>
<p>And I must add one thing - without help (from users) in getting Symbian phone it couldn't been possible to have it. I will want to catch Series 60 3rd edition phone in the future and make support for it too.</p>
<p>From other things:</p>
<ul><li>Mantis case is still not closed (I'm waiting for Michal)
</li><li>if Michal will want, it could possible to display SMS text formatting (like in EMS) in Wammu SMS display screen
</li></ul>
