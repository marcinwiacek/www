<p>I would like to make to kind of summary...and write about nearest time. I had started/created three families: MyGnokii, Gammu, Gammu+</p>

</tr></table><p>Generally you can do what you want with many phones. What can you expect from me in nearest time ?</p>
<p>Today I have updated binaries (win32 versions) for Gammu and Gammu+. First in inside <a href="http://www.mwiacek.com/zips/gsm/gammu/gammu_win32.zip">http://www.mwiacek.com/zips/gsm/gammu/gammu_win32.zip</a> (console is compiled with debug), second inside <a href="http://www.mwiacek.com/zips/gsm/gplus/gplus_win32.zip">http://www.mwiacek.com/zips/gsm/gplus/gplus_win32.zip</a> (it includes console and GUI and replaces all old builds - please remove them from mirrors). I added new article (Polish language) - <a href="?q=node/84">http://www.mwiacek.com/gsm/linuxp.pl/komorki.htm</a></p>
<p>During weekend I will collect patches for test Gammu and release new tarball on Sunday. We will have 10 December.</p>
<p>Up to end of December I hope to have one test Gammu and big progress in Gammu+ GUI (it already has filesystem browsing, getting phonebook memories including call lists, I hope to have getting SMS, calendar, todo, notes, mms, maybe will start with setting something). I say - I hope, because it's possible, that I will write diploma work only.</p>
<p>In January please don't expect anything.</p>
<p>I don't have concrete plans for February and later. I know - I can pay for gammu.org for next few months, without work I will have to close it later.</p>
<p>You can have help me with patches (for example BT/irda/cable drivers for Linux and MacOS for Gammu+ could be really nice gift), testing and thousands of other things. It will motivate me to work on these projects. I'm afraid especially on compatibility Gammu+ GUI with MS Vista.</p>
<p>I don't know, what do you think about this future. Maybe it would good to start discusion on this page (after for example line separator) or mailing list ? Some main questions:</p>
<ul><li>what do you think about writing two family of projects ?
</li><li>what features are really required, but not available ?
</li></ul><hr />
