<p>The best is always the most simple device. So, I think that using Nokia 3310 or 3410 can be very good choice. They have removed some SMS bugs (for example, 3330 has buggy firmware - you have to flash it with 3310 firmware to avoid any problems). Especially 3410 is interesting - has got LiIon battery.</p>
<p>More expensive Nokia phones (with own SMS memory) are more complicated and using them is not always good idea (of course, Gammu can do it).</p>

<p>Another way is is to use special cellular modem especially equiped to continuous work. I recommend Siemens devices - for example Siemens MC35. It has GPRS and can be used to many tasks.</p>
