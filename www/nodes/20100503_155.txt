<p>July 2008 - Brad Brooks, Microsoft's VP of Windows Vista consumer marketing: <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/windows/operatingsystems/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208803153">"We broke a lot of things. We know that, and we know it caused you a lot of pain. It got customers thinking, hey, is Windows Vista a generation we want to get invested in?" </a></p>

<p>Feb 2010 - Anssi Vanjoki, EVP of Markets at Nokia: <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/11183_Video_Anssi_Vanjoki_on_the_N97.php"> (The N97) "has been a tremendous disappointment in terms of the experience quality for the consumers"</a></p>
<p>Apr 2010 - Eldar Murtazin: <a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2010/birulki-64-en.shtml">"I have a feeling that Nokia had settled in some fairyland, where users buy tons of the company products. However, it is not so. Nokia N8 as the flagship looks not just pale, it is something vague. The company will attract the audience with the help of advertising and then start selling the product and it will sell it only to push more people away from the brand. I have an impression that Nokia has agents from another vendor working for it, sabotaging and deliberately destroying Nokia brand. Otherwise it is impossible to explain what is happening."</a></p>
