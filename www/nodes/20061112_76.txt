</li><li>I have released new Gammu+ and started making some [[GPlus:Internals|initial developer docs]]. Generally I must say, that I agree with some Michal's comments - there can be some things still improved internally in this project, but please note that I don't have very big C++ experience and I don't have time for some plays. If you want, please send me patches - I will apply with pleasure.
